Introduction
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm is accompanied by a thorough explanation, code implementation, and example usage. The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear understanding of how different machine learning algorithms work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

Algorithms
Linear Regression
Description: Linear Regression is a simple algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
Code: linear_regression.py
Example: linear_regression_example.py
Logistic Regression
Description: Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of a categorical target variable.
Code: logistic_regression.py
Example: logistic_regression_example.py
Decision Trees
Description: Decision Trees are used for both classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on the value of input features.
Code: decision_tree.py
Example: decision_tree_example.py
Support Vector Machines
Description: Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for classification and regression tasks. They find the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space.
Code: svm.py
Example: svm_example.py
K-Nearest Neighbors
Description: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
Code: knn.py
Example: knn_example.py
Neural Networks
Description: Neural Networks are used for various tasks, including classification and regression, and are the foundation of deep learning.
Code: neural_network.py
Example: neural_network_example.py
Clustering Algorithms
Description: Clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN group similar data points together based on distance or density.
Code: kmeans.py, dbscan.py
Example: clustering_example.py
Dimensionality Reduction
Description: Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE reduce the number of input features while preserving important information.
Code: pca.py, tsne.py
Example: dimensionality_reduction_example.py
