Introduction
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm is accompanied by a thorough explanation, code implementation, and example usage. The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear understanding of how different machine learning algorithms work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

Algorithms

Linear Regression - Linear Regression is a simple algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
Logistic Regression - Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of a categorical target variable.Code: logistic_regression.py
Decision Trees - Decision Trees are used for both classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on the value of input features.
Support Vector Machines - Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for classification and regression tasks. They find the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space.
K-Nearest Neighbors -  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
Neural Networks - Neural Networks are used for various tasks, including classification and regression, and are the foundation of deep learning.
Clustering Algorithms -  Clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN group similar data points together based on distance or density.
Dimensionality Reduction - Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE reduce the number of input features while preserving important information.
